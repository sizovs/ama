# Hi.

<img src="https://sizovs.net/images/me.png" width="100px" />

My name is Eduards Sizovs. I am a software architect, [blogger](https://sizovs.net), [trainer](https://devchampions.com/training/the-principal-developer/), [speaker](https://dev.tube/@eduardsi), and a [conference organizer](https://devternity.com).

I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer. 👨‍💻

Here you can ask me anything. I literally mean *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.
